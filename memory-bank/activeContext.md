# Active Context - Mon May 19 03:51:22 PDT 2025

## Current Work Focus
- Completed Task 7.5: `/cancel_proposal` Command (Proposer Only).
  - Implemented functionality in `ProposalService` to allow proposers to cancel their own proposals.
  - Added unit tests for the command handler in `proposal_command_handlers.py`.
  - Fixed test mismatches in `test_proposal_command_handlers.py` to align test expectations with actual implementation patterns.

## What's Working
- `/cancel_proposal` command allows proposers to cancel their own open proposals.
- Fixed mismatches in test expectations for edit proposal functionality.

## What's Broken or Pending
- **Task 5.2 Follow-ups (Still Pending from previous context):**
    - **Timezone Consistency:** Review and ensure all *other* user-facing datetimes are consistently displayed in PST.
    - **Results Message Copy:** Tweak results message copy in `ProposalService` for channel announcements from "(DM the bot)" to "(DM @botname)".

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Pattern matching for callback data is now properly tested with mocks rather than relying on internal implementation details.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Callback data patterns need to be consistent between handler registrations and tests.
- For callback data patterns that differ between registration and function implementation, mock the function instead of calling it directly in tests.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- When testing callbacks and state transitions, it's more robust to mock the actual handler function rather than testing against its implementation details, especially when pattern transformations happen inside the function.
- The importance of matching regex patterns in callback handlers (e.g., `edit_action_title` vs `edit_prop_title`).

## Current Database/Model State
- No schema changes for Task 7.5.
