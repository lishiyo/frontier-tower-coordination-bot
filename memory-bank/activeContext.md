# Active Context - Sun May 18 20:27:16 PDT 2025

## Current Work Focus
- Successfully refactored `my_proposals_command` from `proposal_command_handlers.py` to `user_command_handlers.py`.
- Moved and updated all associated unit tests for `my_proposals_command` to `test_user_command_handlers.py`.
- Updated `main.py` to reflect the new handler location.
- All relevant unit tests are passing.

## What's Working
- `my_proposals_command` is functioning correctly from its new location in `user_command_handlers.py`.
- Unit tests for `my_proposals_command` in `test_user_command_handlers.py` are passing.
- All previously completed functionalities and their tests remain operational.

## What's Broken or Pending
- **Task 5.2 Follow-ups (Still Pending from previous context):**
    - **Timezone Consistency:** Review and ensure all *other* user-facing datetimes are consistently displayed in PST.
    - **Results Message Copy:** Tweak results message copy in `ProposalService` for channel announcements from "(DM the bot)" to "(DM @botname)".
- The `PTBUserWarning` regarding `per_message=False` in the `ConversationHandler` for `/propose` persists (accepted behavior for now).

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Continue maintaining high unit test coverage for all new features, critical bug fixes, and refactoring efforts.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- When refactoring, ensure all related components (handlers, tests, main application registration) are updated consistently.
- Test files should clearly import the specific units they are testing.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Moving command handlers and their tests between modules requires careful attention to import paths in both the application code and the test files, especially for mock patches.

## Current Database/Model State
- No schema changes during this refactoring.

## Next Steps
- Review `tasks.md` for the next prioritized task.
