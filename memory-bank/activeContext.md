# Active Context - Tue May 13 23:42:07 PDT 2025

## Current Work Focus
- Completing Phase 1 tasks (Project Foundation & Basic Bot Setup).
- Specifically, moving to Task 1.5: Implement `/start` and `/help` commands.

## What's Working
- Python virtual environment is set up.
- Dependencies are installed.
- Environment variables are configured (assuming `.env` file is correctly populated with Supabase details).
- Basic bot structure in `main.py` and `app/config.py` is complete.
- Database setup with Supabase PostgreSQL and Alembic is configured:
    - `app/persistence/database.py` defines the async engine, session, and Base.
    - `alembic.ini` and `alembic/env.py` are configured for asynchronous migrations using the Supabase connection details from `ConfigService`.

## What's Next
- Task 1.5: Implement `/start` and `/help` Commands.
    - Create `app/telegram_handlers/command_handlers.py`.
    - Implement `start_command` and `help_command` functions.
    - Register these handlers in `main.py`.
    - Test bot connectivity and these basic commands.

## Project Decisions
- Using Supabase PostgreSQL as the managed database solution.
- Using SQLAlchemy with `asyncpg` for asynchronous database operations.
- Using Alembic for database migrations.
- Using `python-telegram-bot` as the Telegram bot framework.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Clarified the use of Supabase connection details (component parts vs. full URI) for `.env` and Alembic configuration.
- Ensured `tasks.md` reflects the component-based approach for database credentials consistent with `app/config.py`.

## Current Database/Model State
- Supabase project created and connection details are assumed to be in `.env`.
- Alembic is configured and `app/persistence/database.py` sets up the SQLAlchemy Base.
- No actual database tables (models) have been defined or migrated yet. The system is ready for the first model creation and migration.
