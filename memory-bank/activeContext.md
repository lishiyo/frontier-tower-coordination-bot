# Active Context - Sun May 18 21:43:14 PDT 2025

## Current Work Focus
- Completed the implementation of Task 7.4: `/edit_proposal` command.
  - Implemented conversational flow for editing proposal details (title, description, options).
  - Ensured only the proposer can edit.
  - Prevented edits if submissions already exist.
  - Updated proposal data in the database.
  - Updated the proposal message in the channel.
- Manually tested the `/edit_proposal` functionality.

## What's Working
- `/edit_proposal` command is functioning as per Task 7.4 requirements.
- Existing functionalities remain operational.

## What's Broken or Pending
- Unit tests for Task 7.4 (`/edit_proposal` command and its related service/repository methods) are pending.
- **Task 5.2 Follow-ups (Still Pending from previous context):**
    - **Timezone Consistency:** Review and ensure all *other* user-facing datetimes are consistently displayed in PST.
    - **Results Message Copy:** Tweak results message copy in `ProposalService` for channel announcements from "(DM the bot)" to "(DM @botname)".
- The `PTBUserWarning` regarding `per_message=False` in the `ConversationHandler` for `/propose` persists (accepted behavior for now).

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Prioritize writing unit tests for the newly implemented `/edit_proposal` functionality.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- ConversationHandlers are useful for multi-step interactions like editing.
- Service layer methods should encapsulate business logic (e.g., checking edit permissions, updating channel messages).

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Implementing edit functionality requires careful coordination between command handlers, conversation states, service logic, and repository interactions.
- Updating messages in Telegram channels after an edit requires storing and retrieving `channel_message_id`.

## Current Database/Model State
- No schema changes for Task 7.4. `SubmissionRepository.count_submissions_for_proposal` was added as a method.

## Next Steps
- Write and pass unit tests for the `/edit_proposal` command (Task 7.4).
- Proceed to the next task in `tasks.md` (Task 7.5: `/cancel_proposal`).
