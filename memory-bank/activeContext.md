# Active Context - Sat May 17 16:13:24 PDT 2025

## Current Work Focus
- Transitioning to Phase 4: Voting and Submission Logic.
- Starting with Task 4.1: Define `Submission` SQLAlchemy model and repository.

## What's Working
- Phase 3 (Conversational Proposal Creation & Initial Context) is complete.
- `VectorDBService.get_document_chunks` method is implemented and allows retrieval of specific document chunks from ChromaDB.
- The utility script `app/scripts/view_document_chunks.py` is functional for viewing these stored chunks via the command line.
- All previously completed features from Phase 1, 2, and earlier parts of Phase 3 remain operational.

## What's Broken
- No known issues from the completion of Phase 3.
- New features of Phase 4 are not yet implemented.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- N/A at the start of Phase 4.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- ChromaDB's metadata filtering (e.g., using `where` in `collection.get()`) is a powerful tool for precisely retrieving stored vector data and associated documents.
- Utility scripts are helpful for debugging and verifying data in services like the VectorDB.

## Current Database/Model State
- `users` table exists.
- `proposals` table exists (includes `target_channel_id`).
- `documents` table exists (includes `raw_content`, `id`, `title`, `content_hash`, `source_url`, `upload_date`, `vector_ids` (JSON), `proposal_id` (nullable FK)).
- No new DB schema changes were introduced in Task 3.6.
- The next schema change will be the addition of the `submissions` table as part of Task 4.1.

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 4: Voting and Submission Logic.
    - Task 4.1: Define `Submission` SQLAlchemy model in `app/persistence/models/submission_model.py`.
    - Task 4.1: Generate Alembic migration for the `Submission` table.
    - Task 4.1: Create `SubmissionRepository` in `app/persistence/repositories/submission_repository.py`.
