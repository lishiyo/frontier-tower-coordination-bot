# Progress Log


## Sat May 17 01:24:52 PDT 2025

**Completed:**
- Task 3.4: ConversationHandler for `/propose` (most sub-items completed).
    - Implemented conversational flow for collecting title, description, proposal type, options, duration, and initial context.
    - Fixed `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'id'` in `handle_ask_context` by correctly handling the integer document ID returned from `ContextService`.
    - Fixed `Invalid source_type` error by changing `source_type` in `handle_ask_context` to use `user_text` and `user_url` as expected by `ContextService`.
- Updated `memory-bank/tasks.md`:
    - Moved multi-channel `ASK_CHANNEL` sub-tasks from Task 3.4 to Task 8.8.
    - Added Task 3.5: (Utility) Implement Viewing of Stored Document Chunks.
    - Added Task 6.3: Enhance URL Content Extraction (noting `crawl4ai` as preferred).

**Learnings & Fixes:**
- Ensured `handle_ask_context` correctly processes the integer `document_id` returned by `ContextService.process_and_store_document`.
- Verified that `ContextService` expects `source_type` to end with `_url` or `_text` (e.g., `user_text`, `user_url`).

**Next Steps:**
- Complete any remaining manual testing for Task 3.4 (Conversational `/propose` flow).
- Proceed with Task 3.5: (Utility) Implement Viewing of Stored Document Chunks.
- Address Follow-up Task from 3.4: Refactor repository methods in `DocumentRepository` (`add_document` and `link_document_to_proposal`) to not commit, ensuring the `handle_ask_context` handler manages the entire transaction.


## Sat May 17 00:27:46 PDT 2025

**Completed:**
- Task 3.3: Context Service Setup
    - Created `app/core/context_service.py`.
    - Implemented `ContextService.process_and_store_document` method, including:
        - URL fetching (`_fetch_content_from_url` using `httpx`).
        - Text chunking (using `app.utils.text_processing.simple_chunk_text`).
        - Embedding generation via `LLMService`.
        - Document metadata storage in `DocumentRepository`.
        - Embedding storage in `VectorDBService`, linking SQL Document ID and updating SQL document with vector IDs.
    - Wrote unit tests for `ContextService` in `tests/unit/core/test_context_service.py`.
    - Addressed and fixed issues with `httpx.AsyncClient` mocking in asynchronous context managers within the tests.

**Learnings & Fixes:**
- Correctly mocking `httpx.AsyncClient` when used as an asynchronous context manager requires careful setup of `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods on the mock instance. `MagicMock` should be used for the client yielded by `__aenter__` and for the response object, especially for synchronous attributes/methods like `response.text` or `response.raise_for_status()`.
- Running Python scripts that are part of a package directly (e.g., `python app/services/some_service.py`) can lead to `ModuleNotFoundError` if they use absolute imports from the package root. This is because the script's directory is added to `sys.path` but not necessarily the project root. Solutions include running as a module (`python -m app.services.some_service`) or temporarily modifying `sys.path` within `if __name__ == '__main__':` blocks for example/testing scripts.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with Phase 3: Conversational Proposal Creation & Initial Context.
    - Task 3.4: ConversationHandler for `/propose`.


## Sat May 17 00:02:53 PDT 2025

**Completed:**
- Task 3.1: LLM Service Setup
    - Created `app/services/llm_service.py`.
    - Implemented `generate_embedding(text)` using OpenAI API.
    - Implemented `get_completion(prompt)` using OpenAI API.
    - Implemented `parse_natural_language_duration(text)` using OpenAI API:
        - Developed a stricter prompt to instruct the LLM to return only a datetime string in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC' format or 'ERROR_CANNOT_PARSE'.
        - Included current UTC time as context in the prompt for better relative date parsing.
        - Added logic to parse the LLM's string response into a timezone-aware `datetime` object.
    - User confirmed the `parse_natural_language_duration` function is working as expected after prompt refinement.

**Learnings & Fixes:**
- LLMs can be overly verbose. Initial implementation of `parse_natural_language_duration` resulted in the LLM returning explanations along with the date, causing parsing failures.
- Refining prompts to be very explicit about the desired output format (e.g., "Respond with ONLY...") is crucial for reliable parsing of LLM responses.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with Phase 3: Conversational Proposal Creation & Initial Context.
    - Task 3.2: VectorDB Service Setup & Document Model.

## Fri May 16 22:51:12 PDT 2025

**Completed:**
- Task 2.5: Add Multi-Channel Support to Proposal Model
    - Updated `app/persistence/models/proposal_model.py` to include `target_channel_id`.
    - Generated and edited Alembic migration `cb7185863232_add_target_channel_id_to_proposal.py` to add the new column, update existing rows using `TARGET_CHANNEL_ID` environment variable, and set the column to non-nullable.
    - Updated `app/persistence/repositories/proposal_repository.py` (`add_proposal`) to handle the new field.
    - Updated `app/core/proposal_service.py` (`create_proposal`) to pass `target_channel_id` to the repository.
    - Updated `app/telegram_handlers/command_handlers.py` (`propose_command`) to fetch `TARGET_CHANNEL_ID` from `ConfigService` and pass it to `ProposalService.create_proposal`, and to use the `target_channel_id` from the returned proposal object when posting to the channel.
    - User confirmed the `/propose` command is working after these changes.

**Learnings & Fixes:**
- Corrected a `TypeError` in `propose_command` by ensuring `target_channel_id` was passed to `ProposalService.create_proposal`.
- Emphasized the importance of having the `TARGET_CHANNEL_ID` environment variable available when running Alembic migrations that depend on it for data backfills.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Phase 3: Conversational Proposal Creation & Initial Context.
    - Task 3.1: LLM Service Setup.

## Fri May 16 22:41:10 PDT 2025

**Completed:**
- Task 2.4: Basic `/propose` Command (Static Duration for now).
    - Implemented `/propose` command handler in `app/telegram_handlers/command_handlers.py`.
    - `ProposalService.create_proposal` now handles basic proposal creation logic.
    - Proposals are posted to the `TARGET_CHANNEL_ID`.
    - DM confirmation sent to proposer.
    - Channel message ID is stored for future updates.
- Addressed `telegram.error.BadRequest` for free-form proposals in channels:
    - Removed `switch_inline_query_current_chat` button from channel messages for free-form proposals in `app/telegram_handlers/command_handlers.py`.
    - Updated `memory-bank/testing_instructions.md` to reflect that channel messages for free-form proposals will use text instructions instead of an interactive button.
- Updated design documents for multi-channel proposal handling:
    - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`: Updated with multi-channel user stories and functional requirements.
    - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`: Updated to reflect multi-channel capabilities in `ProposalService`, `ConfigService`, data flows, and proposal model.
    - `memory-bank/tasks.md`: Added `target_channel_id` to `Proposal` model definition (Task 2.3), clarified its usage in single-channel mode for Task 2.4, and added Task 2.5 for database migration and Task 8.8 for full multi-channel implementation.

**Learnings & Fixes:**
- `switch_inline_query_current_chat` buttons are not suitable for messages posted by a bot to a channel, as they can lead to `telegram.error.BadRequest` if the user hasn't interacted with the bot directly or if the bot's username isn't implicitly known in the channel context. Relying on clear text instructions for such cases is more robust.
- Ensured task list (`tasks.md`) correctly reflects the need for a database migration (Task 2.5) after realizing `target_channel_id` was not part of the initial Task 2.3 implementation.

**Next Steps:**
- Task 2.5: Add Multi-Channel Support to Proposal Model
    - Update the `Proposal` SQLAlchemy model to include `target_channel_id`.
    - Generate and apply an Alembic migration to add the `target_channel_id` column to the `proposals` table, with a default value for existing records.
    - Update repository and service layers to correctly handle the new field.

## Fri May 16 21:25:44 PDT 2025

**Completed:**
- Task 2.2: Implicit User Registration
    - Created `app/core/user_service.py` with `register_user_interaction` method.
    - Modified `start_command` in `app/telegram_handlers/command_handlers.py` to call `UserService.register_user_interaction`.
- Task 2.3: Proposal Model & Repository
    - Defined `Proposal` SQLAlchemy model in `app/persistence/models/proposal_model.py`.
    - Created `ProposalRepository` in `app/persistence/repositories/proposal_repository.py` with methods for adding, getting, and updating proposals.
    - Addressed issues with Alembic autogeneration:
        - Ensured models are imported in `app/persistence/models/__init__.py`.
        - Explicitly imported model classes in `alembic/env.py`.
        - Set `revision_environment = true` in `alembic.ini`.
        - Manually populated the migration script `0cb97eaf1e36_create_proposal_table.py` when autogeneration still failed to produce a complete script despite `target_metadata` appearing correct.
    - Applied the (manually populated) migration `0cb97eaf1e36_create_proposal_table.py` to create the `proposals` table.
    - Removed debug print statement from `alembic/env.py`.

**Learnings & Fixes:**
- Alembic autogeneration can be sensitive. Even with correct `target_metadata` and model imports, it may fail to detect changes. Setting `revision_environment = true` in `alembic.ini` is crucial. If problems persist, manually creating or populating migration scripts is a viable workaround.
- Ensured `app/persistence/models/__init__.py` imports all model classes.

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: User Management and Core Proposal Features (Static)
    - Task 2.4: Basic `/propose` Command (Static Duration for now)

## Fri May 16 21:05:44 PDT 2025

**Completed:**
- Task 2.1: User Model & Repository
    - Defined `User` SQLAlchemy model in `app/persistence/models/user_model.py`.
    - Created `UserRepository` in `app/persistence/repositories/user_repository.py` with `get_or_create_user` and `get_user_by_telegram_id` methods.
    - Populated and applied Alembic migration `8aa34f61aaa0_create_user_table.py` to create the `users` table.

**Learnings & Fixes:**
- Encountered `socket.gaierror` during `alembic upgrade head` due to DNS resolution issues with the Supabase direct database hostname (e.g., `db.<project_ref>.supabase.co`).
- Debugged DNS resolution using `dig @8.8.8.8 <hostname>`, which confirmed the direct DB hostname was not resolving publicly (`ANSWER: 0`).
- The general project API hostname (e.g., `<project_ref>.supabase.co`) and the connection pooler hostname (e.g., `aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com`) were resolvable.
- Resolved the database connection issue by switching the `POSTGRES_HOST` and `POSTGRES_USER` in `.env` to use the Supabase **connection pooler** details. This allowed `alembic upgrade head` to succeed.
- Corrected `app/config.py` to ensure `get_database_url()` properly constructs the connection string from individual `POSTGRES_*` environment variables.
- Added explicit import of `user_model` to `alembic/env.py` for robustness in migration autogeneration.

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: User Management and Core Proposal Features (Static)
    - Task 2.2: Implicit User Registration

## Wed May 14 16:29:25 PDT 2025

**Completed:**
- Task 1.5: Implement `/start` and `/help` Commands.
    - Created `app/telegram_handlers/command_handlers.py`.
    - Implemented `start_command` and `help_command`.
    - Registered handlers in `main.py`.
    - Resolved `ImportError` for `DatabaseManager` in `main.py` by commenting out the import.
    - Fixed asyncio event loop errors in `main.py` by refactoring to a synchronous main function.
    - Addressed Telegram message formatting issues by switching to `ParseMode.HTML` in `help_command`.
    - Created initial unit tests for `start_command` and `help_command` in `tests/unit/telegram_handlers/test_command_handlers.py`.
    - Added manual testing instructions to `memory-bank/testing_instructions.md`.

**Learnings & Fixes:**
- Ensured `main.py` correctly uses `config_service.get_bot_token()`.
- Identified and resolved asyncio event loop conflicts caused by `asyncio.run()` and `application.run_polling()`.
- Switched from `ParseMode.MARKDOWN` to `ParseMode.HTML` for more robust message formatting in Telegram, especially for text containing special characters or code examples.
- Confirmed the need for `pytest-asyncio` for running asynchronous tests and advised on installation.

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: User Management and Core Proposal Features (Static)
    - Task 2.1: User Model & Repository
